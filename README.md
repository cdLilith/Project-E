# Project-E
A very poorly written discord economy bot.


It comes with two fun(not really) games coinflip and dices.
Please tell me anything i can improve on thanks <3.
 (Yes i know the code is awful)

I advise to edit it so that it can work with databases, it currently use json files to store data which is a bad practise
Also you need to make a users.json file so it can work properly
